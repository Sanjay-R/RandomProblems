# RandomProblems

This repository isn't a single project, but rather it's just me testing out interesting problems and trying to find the (most optimal) solutions. If you have any suggestions/feedback, please don't be shy to add and/or reach out.

## Libraries and frameworks used
This project is built using Gradle, mainly to personally test it out and get the hang of it.
This is also to try using best practices when writing code. Standard Java libraries will be used.
